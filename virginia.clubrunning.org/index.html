				<p>
					The club practices Monday through Thursday at Nameless Field, near Memorial Gym. Practices are held at
					5:00pm during the fall. During the spring, practices will be held at 5:00pm on Monday/Thursday, and 
					4:00pm Tuesday/Wednesday. After the clock shifts on March 9th, the time for all days will be 5:00pm.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					No practices are mandatory; some runners attend only a few practices a week while many of our
					runners attend as many as possible. Members also frequently organize their own runs on weekends, and
					many track their runs on Strava.

				The club attends more than half a dozen cross country and track meets throughout the year, including
				NIRCA Regional and National Championships. We have the opportunity to compete against a variety of
				Division III and club teams from across the country, and the Hoos represent well at almost every meet.
				The club offers runners of all skill levels an opportunity to push themselves to race at a collegiate
				level without the time commitment of a varsity team. <a href="meets">See our meet schedule</a>

				The club enjoys a close-knit social community in addition to its training. We host team parties, enjoy
				group dinner after practice every evening, organize intramural teams for soccer and dodgeball, and go on
				day trips to Kings Dominion, Carter Mountain, and other nearby attractions. We&rsquo;re a
				close-knit group that loves to welcome new members&mdash;we hope you can find your place with us! Oh,
