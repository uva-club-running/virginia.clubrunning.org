				<p class="accompanies-top-line">
					The Rivanna Trails, named for the river they follow, are a series of trails which form a giant circle around most of Charlottesville. Well maintained with many relatively flat stretches, they provide some of the best local running, and are a staple for the team. Easy spots to get on the trail include behind Observatory Hill, The Park at North Grounds, and along Barracks Road.

					Dick Woods. The famous Dick Woods. There is simply nowhere like it on Earth. The perfect place for a long run, it is a team favorite for Sunday mornings. An out-and-back which has no known end, it is a beautiful road including woods, farms, hills, and a spectacular view of the Blue Ridge mountains. It is about a 25 minute drive from UVA, and is more than worth it, guaranteed.

				<h3 class="top-line">Foxhaven</h3>
				<p class="accompanies-top-line">
					Foxhaven (also known as Bellair) is a neighborhood on Canterbury Road off Ivy Road. A 2.25 mile loop, Foxhaven is a great workout location which can accommodate anything from a short interval workout to a longer tempo run. Foxhaven also connects to Reservoir via Foxhaven Farm Road, forming a larger loop with Alderman Road of about 6 miles.

				<h3 class="top-line">Reservoir</h3>
				<p class="accompanies-top-line">
					Reservoir is a great place for a moderate run or a workout. With big hills and known 1000 and 1600 meter marks, the team often comes here for interval workouts. This out-and-back road is located roughly 2.5 miles from Nameless  Field off Fontaine Avenue on Reservoir Road.

				<h3 class="top-line">Lannigan Field</h3>
				<p class="accompanies-top-line">
					Open to the public as of August 2012, the track at Lannigan Field is one the newest and nicest you&rsquo;ll run on. Not only does it offer a high quality and recently resurfaced red track, but it also has a soft surface loop, made of field turf, around the outside of the stands. The track is open to the public Monday through Friday from dawn to 10 AM and from 7 PM to 9 PM. On the weekends it is open dawn to 10 AM and from 2 PM until dusk.
